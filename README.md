# votes-dapp

My test project to get the basic ideas about developing smart contracts and the related stuff.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
  accounts      Prints the list of accounts
  check         Check whatever you need
  clean         Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
  compile       Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts
  console       Opens a hardhat console
  coverage      Generates a code coverage report for tests
  flatten       Flattens and prints contracts and their dependencies
  help          Prints this message
  node          Starts a JSON-RPC server on top of Hardhat Network
  run           Runs a user-defined script after compiling the project
  test          Runs mocha tests
  verify        Verifies contract on Etherscan

  add-voting    Adds a new voting with candidates
  get-details   Shows details of the voting
  get-votings   Shows all votings
  finish-voting finishes the voting and rewards the winner
  vote          Adds a vote from the voter for the candidate
  withdraw      transfers gathered comission to the owner
```
